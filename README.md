## Project Overview

In the highly competitive market of customer acquisition and retention, companies are constantly seeking to better understand their customer base. Analyzing existing customers' demographics and behavior patterns can provide valuable insights into potential target groups and help tailor marketing strategies to maximize customer acquisition and retention. This project aims to analyze demographics data for a mail-order sales company in order to identify potential new customers within the general population.

The project's origin lies in the need for an efficient and data-driven approach to customer segmentation, which can help the company focus its marketing efforts on the most promising segments of the population. The project will leverage two datasets: one containing demographic information about the company's existing customers, and another containing demographic information about the general population. By comparing the characteristics of the company's customers with those of the general population, we aim to identify key differences and similarities that can be used to target new customers more effectively.

## Problem Statement

The problem to be solved is to identify potential new customers for the mail-order sales company by analyzing and comparing the demographic characteristics of the company's existing customers with those of the general population. This will help the company better understand its customer base, focus its marketing efforts on the most promising segments of the population, and ultimately increase customer acquisition and retention.

To solve this problem, we will first preprocess and clean the provided datasets to ensure that they are suitable for analysis. Next, we will employ dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA to reduce the complexity of the data and speed up the analysis. We will then apply clustering algorithms such as K-means to segment the general population into distinct groups based on their demographic characteristics. By comparing the distribution of clusters in the customer dataset with those in the general population dataset, we will identify overrepresented and underrepresented clusters in the customer base. This information will be used to draw insights about the customer base relative to the general population and help target new customers more effectively.

The expected solution is a clear and actionable segmentation of the general population, highlighting the most promising segments for customer acquisition. This will enable the company to focus its marketing efforts on the identified target groups, leading to more efficient use of resources and improved customer acquisition and retention rates.
